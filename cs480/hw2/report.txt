Ex1: 

Which features (in P_2 \ P_1) did you successfully implemented?



Which features (in P_2 \ P_1) did you attempt but failed? 
(remember to comment out those lines so that your program still runs...)






Ex2: (Extra Credit)
     How did you implement this checking, if you succeeded at it?


Ex3:

(a) What are the command-line commands you used (including C compiling)?



(b) Include your very short but kinda "pathetic" Python code 




    and the most important lines 
    from the resulting Cython translation, with your key comments.





(c) What are the most striking differences you noticed between 
    the Cython solution and your solution? 
	 




(d) [EXTRA CREDIT, 1 pt)
    List some rather basic Python features that Cython can not handle.






Debriefing questions:

1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?

2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?

3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
   Note: Only high-level discussions are allowed. 
         Include the names of the people you discussed with.

4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%â€“100%)? 

5. Any other comments (on the instruction)?
