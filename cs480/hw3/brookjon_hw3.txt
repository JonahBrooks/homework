Ex1: P_2 in pure CFG notation:

This is technically P_3 in pure CFG notation, since I'm using P_3 instead:
''' P_3 grammar in pure CFG:
   program : module
   module : stmt_list
   stmt : simple_stmt NEWLINE
        | if_stmt NEWLINE 
        | for_stmt NEWLINE
   stmt_list : stmt
             | stmt stmt_listt

   simple_stmt : "print" expr_list
               | name "=" expr

   expr_list : expr
             | expr_list "," expr

   if_stmt : "if" expr ":" simple_stmts 
           | "if" expr ":" NEWLINE INDENT stmt_list DEDENT

   for_stmt : "for" name "in" "range" "(" expr ")" ":" simple_stmts 
            | "for" name "in" "range" "(" expr ")" ":" NEWLINE INDENT stmt_list DEDENT

   simple_stmts : simple_stmt ";" simple_stmt       // Is this right? Or should P_2 have had * here?
                | simple_stmts ";" simple_stmt

   comp_list: expr comp_op expr
            | comp_list comp_op expr

   expr     : name
            | decint
            | "-" expr
            | expr "+" expr
            | "(" expr ")"
            | expr "if" expr "else" expr
            | expr "and" expr
            | expr "or" expr
            | "not" expr
            | comp_list
            | "True"
            | "False"
            | "(" expr "if" expr "else" expr ")"

   comp_op : '<' | '>' | '==' | '>=' | '<=' | '<>' | '!='

Ex2: What difficulties did you encounter?

I found it really hard to tell what was going wrong when it failed somewhere in the middle.
I think my lexer works now, but it was tough finding errors in it to begin with.


Ex2a: How was INDENT/DEDENT implemented?

I didn't end up getting time to really look into it.
Presumably either uses some sort of counting stack, or does something recursively?

Ex2b: [EXTRA CREDIT] Any smarter way for the above than what I put on the slides?


Ex3: What difficulties did you encounter?

Debugging ended up taking far longer than I had anticipated, which led to me running out of time.
I'm sure I could get it fixed through enough testing, line by line, but I would need another half
dozen hours or so to get it all right, it seems.


     Any comments on PLY?
The error messages are really vague, and the documentation I found was rather sparse.
It was really fun to mess around with though!


Debriefing questions:

1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?

20 or so, I think.

2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?

Moderate, but much more time consuming than I anticipated.

3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
   Note: Only high-level discussions are allowed. 
         Include the names of the people you discussed with.

Completely alone.

4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%â€“100%)? 

80% I still have a hard time telling what will and won't work.

5. Any other comments (on the instruction)?

This was fun, but I wish I had been able to give it the time to finish.
