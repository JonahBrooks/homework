1. Checking availability status via app:

The user can open the mobile app and view a graphical representation of which machines are open or in use.
The user can see a chart of the various machines with a color coded indicator for the status of each one.
Machines labled with green will be available. Machines labeled with red will be in use.


2. Laundry is done notification:

After starting his or her laundry, the user will tell the server which machine he or she is using.
The user's mobile device will then notify him or her when the laundry is done.
This notification will be given regardless of whether or not the app is active on the mobile device.
