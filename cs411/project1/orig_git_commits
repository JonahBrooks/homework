I wrote some basic skeleton code a few days ago, including a basic dot product function. Today I filled in the functionality for dining.ccp, as well as completed the serial version of the matrix multiplication problem. Both files need slight refactoring, including comments and headers. Then I just need to fill in the hooks I have for threading support in matrix.cpp and write the write-up.
