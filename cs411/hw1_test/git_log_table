Mon, 16 Apr 2012 21:25:19 -0700 & Feature complete. I just need to add my headers, clean up the file, then time it / write it up. \\ \hline
Sat, 14 Apr 2012 19:56:06 -0700 & Initial commit. I wrote some basic skeleton code a few days ago, including a basic dot product function. Today I filled in the functionality for dining.ccp, as well as completed the serial version of the matrix multiplication problem. Both files need slight refactoring, including comments and headers. Then I just need to fill in the hooks I have for threading support in matrix.cpp and write the write-up. \\ \hline
