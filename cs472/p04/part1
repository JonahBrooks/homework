Summary of paper 1:

This paper focuses on how to optimize code for cache use. 
It cites the increasing disparity between CPU speeds and memory access speeds as an important reason to optimize one's code for cache use.
This is especially the case in consoles, where the cache size and performance don't increase between generations, so all increase in speed must come from optimization.
Numerous methods of optimization were covered for both data and code memory.
For code cache, the author suggested restructuring code to increase hit rate, as well as avoiding unrolled loops, in-line macros, and object oriented programming.
For data cache, many more suggestions were made, including ways of organizing structures to optimize for locality, 
ways of prefetching and preloading to increase hit rate, and ways of arranging data to account for line size in cache.
Many methods for analyzing cache usage were also given, including using functions to count data access rates, using gcc compiler options, or using commercial products designed for that purpose.
The remainder of the paper discussed aliasing, how it can complicate the optimization process, and how to avoid those complications.

Summary of paper 2:

117 pages. My GRE is scheduled for 2 days before this assignment is due, and I am not a quick reader. 
Unfortunately I'm going to have to prioritize my GRE and hope to get back to this.
