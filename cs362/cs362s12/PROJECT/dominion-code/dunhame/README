Known Bugs: 

 [ ] Invoking the game without any arguments will cause it to segfault, because
    atoi gets confused with no argv. Invoking with ./playdom $not-a-number will
    cause atoi to ask for an integer to use. 

 [ ] Player Interface issues:
    [ ] Accepts bad input ("buy silver" is apparently a bad input) and 
        ends up with a "?" card in the hand. Should instead re-ask until
        it gets a valid card, or translate more leniently from typo'd 
        card names into supply numbers.
    [ ] Goes ZOOM! if bad input causes two bots to play each other. Should 
        confirm that the player intended bot vs. bot, then offer some delay.
        Possibly also witty remarks from the robots to keep it entertaining.

 [ ] Documentation:
    [ ] Needs either defaults or a shell script to invoke the game with sane argv
    [ ] Comments should explain scope of each function -- should buyCard decrement
        the coins, or is that the problem of whoever invoked it? This will be
        very nice to have when we move from unit to integration testing.
