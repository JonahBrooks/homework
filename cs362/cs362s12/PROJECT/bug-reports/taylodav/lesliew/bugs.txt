lesliew:
	-When buying a card, the buying function doesn’t decrease the coin count of the player by the correct amount
	-the discard count for the player is not what is to be expected 
	- the supply count of the cards of each type are not decreasing properly either.
	SOLUTION:
		looking generally at buying cards, and not buying specific cards. Look specifically at each card’s value, decrement the player’s coin cost by the cost 		of the card, even if it is zero, decrease the buy count, increase your discard count, and decrease the supply count, and this should solve a lot of the 	problems that are present.
