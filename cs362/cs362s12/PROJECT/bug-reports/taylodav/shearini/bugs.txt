shearini:
	-the numBuys left for the player did not match what was expected.
	-the implementation is not decrementing the number of buys correctly for a player
	-buyCard never takes into account the possibility of buying a card that has a value of 0, like a curse card
	SOLUTION:
		altering the coin check conditional from [if (state->coins < getCost(supplyPos))] to [if (state->coins <= getCost(supplyPos))].
		decrement the numBuys of the player by 1 per buy.
		
something wrong with buying a card with various number of available buys
