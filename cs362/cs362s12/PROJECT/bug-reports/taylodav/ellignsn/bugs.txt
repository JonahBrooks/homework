ellingsn:
	-the player’s discard count is off by 1
	-following conclusion. The numbuys is definitely not decremented properly, the player’s coin count is also not decremented properly
	-Original implementation, need to change this!!
	SOLUTION:
		decrement the player’s coin cost by the cost of the card, even if it is zero, decrease the buy count, increase your discard count, and decrease the 		supply count
		
	-numBuys were not changing at all
	-line 264 (state->numBuys)--;
	-Solution: remove the parenthesis
	
**This implementation is stock, no changes made**
