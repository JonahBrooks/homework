add:
	**state->phase = 1;**
here:
	gainCard(supplyPos, state, 0, whoseTurn(state));
	state->coins -= getCost(supplyPos);
	state->numBuys -= 1;
	return 0;

doesn’t look at the number of buys a player has, 
but instead just the number of coins and the card supply
SOLUTION: I would recommend changing the code so that it checks to make 
	sure that there is the right number coins, necessary number of buys and 
	that there is the right supply count
