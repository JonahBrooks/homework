brookjon buyCard Bug
	Running my test I found that neither coins nor supplyCount was being modified after buy. 
	
	
	FIX: add on or around Lines 265 and 266
	
	state->supplyCount[supplyPos]--;
    	state->coins -= getCost(supplyPos);
	
	By adding the two lines I have fixed the bug and it passes my test.
