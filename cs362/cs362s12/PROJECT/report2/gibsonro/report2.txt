
Test suite 2: Random Games

This test suite creates a list of random player behavior including buyCard, playCard and endTurn. It then executes this script and attempts to play a game.



With occasionally strategic logic:
Lines executed:65.34% of 580

I had managed to get up to 75% coverage, but I wasn't able to replicate it after changing the strategy logic.
