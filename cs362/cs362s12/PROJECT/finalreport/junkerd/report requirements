Detailed discussion of test approach taken
	Detailed discussion of the test process
	I want to see source code – show, don’t just tell
		Not a dump of all your code, but representative portions to indicate any of these that apply:
	Structure of a test case
	Length of test cases
	Method for choosing inputs
	Specification method used
	How to handle segfaults/crashes
Development history of the test system
Complete set of test statistics gathered:  coverages, number of tests performed, number of faults detected, etc.
	Areas particularly well tested, areas that have not been thoroughly tested – remaining risks of failure
Communications with partners
	Give some representative examples, show me what a bug report and response looked like
	Revisions to tested code (and to tester)
Regression strategy, regression failures discovered
Quality of code 
	on first testing
	when finished
	Lines of code at beginning, when finished
Final status of all bugs reported so far (FIXED, WONTFIX, BOGUS…)
	Details of bugs (possibly of all discovered bugs, if it fits), including the severity, nature, fix, pointer to test case (or full test case if it is small enough)
Opinions for future testers
	What would you have done differently, given time
	How well did any tools you used work?
	What infrastructure did you develop or did you need
	How useful was automated testing vs. hand unit tests vs. code inspection, in your case?
