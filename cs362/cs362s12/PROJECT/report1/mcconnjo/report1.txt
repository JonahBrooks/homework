buyCard Test

For the first test I chose to test the function that we were required to
implement. With buyCard there are a number of pre and post conditions that I
wanted to test. When the buyCard function is called certain things must
change. The first is the coins should be decremented by the amount that is
returned by getCost(). Second, supplyCount[supplyPos] should be decremented by
one. Third, the discard of the current player should add that card which was
purchased and then increment its count. Finally, the number of buys should be
decremented by one. 

There are some preconditions for buyCard to work, which I am testing for.
First is that there is still a supply of that particular count, this is done
by making sure that its count is greater than 0. Next is to make sure that the
person is not buying something when they have no more numBuys left. Third is
that the player has enough coins to buy the card.

Currently the tests are not working properly and the asserts fail when they
should not be failing.
