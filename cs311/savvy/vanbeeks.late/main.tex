My design decisions for this assignment consisted of not using malloc, hard coding the number of children (for a total of 50), not reading in input from the user for the number of children, left punctuation in, and I didn't use functions. I was originally planning on going back and use mallac since I didn't with the last assignment, but I ran out of time trying to just get the program working to go back and try to implement malloc. So because of that I just hard coded the number of children that the

program makes at 50. Then when parsing I chose to leave the punctuation in including periods, comas, and apostrophes. I also chose not to use functions. Not for any real reason, I just ended up putting it all in the one file. I also recieved debugging help from Jonah Brooks.
