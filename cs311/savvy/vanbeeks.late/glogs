Tue Feb 7 22:49:21 2012 -0800 & I forgot to commit yesterday, but today and yesterday I was able to fix quite a few bugs (one being me typing fdclose instead of just fclose, that one was fun..). My parser is finished, it makes every word lowercase and feeds through the pipes properly, and it then goes through the sort to the suppressor like it should. Still working on getting the words in from the sort and sorting those together in the right order. \\ \hline
Sun Feb 5 22:58:20 2012 -0800 & Finished the fdopen, fputs, and fgets. I fixed an unfortunate fork bomb, fixed segmentation faults, and my code compiles without errors. However it doesn't appear to do what it needs to, but that is for tomorrow. \\ \hline
Fri Feb 3 21:53:14 2012 -0800 & Forking is done, pipe creation is done, pipe deletion is mostly done (still in progress), and distinquishment between parent/ child/ and suppressor. \\ \hline
Wed Feb 1 22:57:30 2012 -0800 & Worked on the basic code. I created a very basic parser. Started making my pipes and forked. I think I found a way to ID the children, and closed the unneccessary pipes. And did a lot more reading.. \\ \hline
Mon Jan 30 17:53:08 2012 -0800 & Started the outline of the code and did a lot more reading \\ \hline
