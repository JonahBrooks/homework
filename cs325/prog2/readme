Programming Assingment #2
CS325
02-19-2012

Savannah Van Beek and I (Jonah Brooks) worked on the second programming assignment together. 

We zipped it up. There were 5 files, DeterministicSelect, RandomizedSelect, SillySelect, Pivot_Finder (for the DeterministicSelect), and time. 

DeterministicSelect:
	This funtion implements the Deterministic Select algorithm. 

Pivot_Finder
	This function was used by the DeterministicSelect function to find the pivot values. 

RandomizedSelect:
	This function implements the Randomized Select algorithm. 

SillySelect:
	This function implements the program iteratively. 

Time:
	This found the average time, min time, and max time.

*Note: DeterministicSelect and RandomizedSelect were ran under the assumption of no duplicates entries.
