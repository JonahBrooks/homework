TEAM MEMBERS:
	This project was completed by Jonah Brooks and Savannah Van Beek.



To run this program, use the following format:

program_name start_text_file goal_text_file mode output_text_file

Where start_text_file and goal_text_file are formatted such that exactly one character separates each number (the example input files on the class website work for this).

The results will be printed to the specified output_text_file.

Mode is as listed on the class website: dfs, bfs, iddfs, astar (note, any word such that the first character is d, b, i, or a will also work)
